# GameResChange
Change the resolution of any app/game on Android 13+

Think of it as a privacy friendly version of Samsung's Game Booster/Game Optimizer Service, Samsung's app sends a list of all installed apps to Samsung servers (which is very invasive imo), my app/module aims to achieve the same thing without such needless invasiviness 


### Xposed 
 The included Xposed module is only required on devices running Android 15-16 in order to support all apps, you don't need to enable it on A13-14
